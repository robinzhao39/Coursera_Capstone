# Coursera_Capstone

This capstone project uses location data from FourSquare to cluster neighborhoods of Toronto based on similarities through KNN machine learning algorithm. It also displays the ten top most popular venues in each neighborhood. This is useful because if one person decides to move from a neighborhood to another neighborhood, that person is able to use the results of this project to determine a similar neighborhood and its top characteristics.
